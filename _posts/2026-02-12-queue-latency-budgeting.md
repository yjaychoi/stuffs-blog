This is a sample entry for layout validation.

The goal is to add one more real post in the timeline so previous/next navigation can be checked with three posts instead of two.

## Why this exists

- verify title wrapping behavior in post navigation
- verify alignment for both previous and next links
- verify spacing consistency on desktop and mobile

## Notes

Remove or replace this post after navigation and typography QA are complete.
